I'm an Assistant Professor at the United States Military Academy. I did my graduate school work at Vanderbilt University and my undergraduate at USMA, all in electrical engineering. My professional experience has focused more on cyberspace and I'm currently running the Cyber Research Center in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at USMA. 

I'm creating this site mainly for fun - and to document some things better. Please feel free to use anything you find useful. I just ask that you cite me where appropriate. 

The opions expressed on this site are solely my own and do not reflect the opinions of the Department of Defense, U.S. Army, or the United States Military Academy.
