I created a new course in the first semester of the 2021 academic year. This course was necessary becuase we created a new Cyber Science major and needed to cover certain topics for ABET accrediation. This course also covered a few requirement (like databases) for our computer science majors. This is the first course all cyber and computer science take, along with intro to programming.
