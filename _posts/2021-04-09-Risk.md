I created a new course in the first semester of the 2021 academic year. This course was necessary because we created a new Cyber Science major and needed to cover certain topics for ABET accreditation. This course also covered a few requirements (like databases) for our computer science majors. This is the first course all cyber and computer science take, along with intro to programming. I may write about this course and process later. I bring it up now because risk and risk management were topics I created lessons for and this got me really interested in this topic. 

In the first version of the course I taught these topics uses the Army's method [ATP 5-19](https://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/DR_pubs/DR_a/pdf/web/atp5_19.pdf) as well as ISC<sup>2</sup>'s method from a typical CISSP course. These methods are very similar when doing qualitative analysis, but of course the Army doesn't talk about Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE) much. The students struggled a little to apply this information later in the course and that got me wondering if what and how I was teaching was correct.........and opened the risk management rabbit hole! 

I was attending the SANS ICS summit this year and saw a researcher from [DRAGOS](https://www.dragos.com/) present a talk on a subject in this area. His talk was super interesting (and I love ICS), so I decided to start my exploration with his paper which you can find [here](https://www.dragos.com/blog/industry-news/risky-business-maturing-ot-security-with-executives/). This paper will require several posts because there are that many interesting things. I'm going to start with the introductions and definitions before really getting into the process weeds. 

According to their report, the DRAGOS cyber risk management process is "designed for scalability and can be applied to any environment." This of course taken in context of the report is referring to IS environments, but I think there is plenty of overlap with traditional IT. NIST defines risk as: 
>"The level of impact on organizational operations, assets, or individuals resulting from the operation of an information system given the potential impact of a threat and the likelihood of that threat occurring."

The DRAGOS report says this definition of is to information-centric and defines "industrial cyber risk" as:
>"The potential loss of life, injury, damaged assets, financial loss, and other harm from the failure or mis-operation of digital technologies and communication networks used for operational capabilities."

I find this interesting already! The DRAGOS definition is definitely more specific and tailored to ICS environment, but is it really different?
